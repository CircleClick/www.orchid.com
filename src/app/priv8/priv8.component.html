    <h4 class="priv8__heading">Freedom vs. Safety</h4>
    <p>
        The summit will feature keynotes from all fronts of the privacy war, with a keynote address from the
        whistleblower and cybersecurity expert, Edward Snowden. The conference will shine a light on the battle-lines
        drawn between freedom and security in our seemingly perpetual privacy crisis. Each day of the summit will focus
        on a different aspect of digital privacy, from how we communicate, to how we transact, to how we live in an era
        of pervasive digital surveillance.

            <b>EDWARD SNOWDEN</b>
            <span>Whistleblower & Cybersecurity Expert</span>
            <p>
                The author of the new memoir, Permanent Record, former CIA officer and National Security Agency (NSA)
                consultant Snowden risked everything to expose the U.S. government’s system of mass surveillance. He is
                the subject of the Oscar-winning best documentary Citizenfour and the critically acclaimed Oliver Stone
                film, Snowden. Appearing live from Moscow, Snowden continues to speak out about technologies and
                practices (increasingly by nongovernmental entities) that have created “the most effective means of
                social control in the history of our species.” “Everything we do now lasts forever. Not because we want
                to remember, but because we are no longer allowed to forget,” he says, evoking the key theme of
                Permanent Record. “Helping to create that system is my greatest regret.” As one of the world’s most
                passionate and authoritative voices on privacy and cybersecurity, Snowden continues to warn us of the
                growing threats of our digital age.
            </p>
            <p>
                Edward Snowden shocked the world in 2013 when he broke with the intelligence establishment and revealed
                that the U.S. government was pursuing an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the potential to
                collect every single phone call, text message and email of every person on earth. Fearing arrest, he
                fled to Hong Kong, where he secretly met with journalists from The Guardian newspaper and filmmaker
                Laura Poitras. Poitras later won an Academy Award for Citizenfour. The Guardian and The Washington Post
                were awarded a Pulitzer Prize for their role in reporting on the NSA leaks. Snowden saw this honor as “a
                vindication” of his efforts to bring the secret surveillance programs to light. Snowden himself has
                received numerous honors for his public service, including the Right Livelihood Award, the German
                Whistleblower Prize, the Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling and the Carl von Ossietzky Medal from the
                International League of Human Rights. He currently serves as president of the board of directors of the
                Freedom of the Press Foundation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since gaining asylum in Russia, Snowden has remained in the headlines as an impassioned and
                authoritative champion of privacy, civil liberties and cybersecurity during what he calls “the greatest
                redistribution of power since the Industrial Revolution.” Based on Snowden’s revelations, both the US
                and UK governments have faced court challenges to their surveillance laws, prompting new legislation in
                both countries. Internet companies, reacting to public outrage over privacy concerns, have made
                encryption commonplace. Snowden continues to sound the alarm on mass surveillance and the collection of
                data by both governments and corporate entities. He has been invited to speak at venues ranging from
                international investment conferences to the TED stage and the Sorbonne—receiving glowing reviews and
                passionate applause from audiences around the world.
