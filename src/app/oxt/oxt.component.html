        <p class="medium">
          Orchid is uniquely designed to offer online privacy at a competitive cost. The design is intended to result in
          bandwidth being priced dynamically to meet the needs of both users and providers. This is done through a
          unique
          decentralized bandwidth marketplace, where numerous providers can compete to offer their services to users.
        </p>
        <p class="medium">
          The price of bandwidth on Orchid is designed to fluctuate with the market, so there is no set "price" of
          bandwidth on the network. Bandwidth providers are free to set their own rates, and Orchid itself does not
          mandate pricing. Nonetheless, we expect prices to remain competitive with existing VPNs and privacy solutions.

        A maximum 1 billion OXT were eligible for creation, all of which has been created. Orchid Labs, Inc. holds
        407,059,272 OXT in its treasury. Pursuant to Orchid Lab, Inc.'s treasury policy, it is anticipated that as to
        400,579,272 OXT of the treasury OXT, starting as of December 9, 2019, no more than 10 million OXT per month
        will be available to be released from the company's treasury. While such treasury OXT will become available
        for potential release each month, Orchid may instead continue to hold such OXT in its treasury. The other
        6,480,000 OXT in the company's treasury is not subject to the treasury policy and is available to be released
        without restriction.

        $.30 per OXT), including for the purpose of making OXT available to participants in educational programs on
        using
        the Orchid network, which program is run by a third party ("Educational Purposes"). An additional 52,500,000 OXT
        will be released for Educational Purposes, in three tranches of 17,500,000 OXT every 6 months, beginning on June
        23, 2020. 11,661,996 OXT will be distributed to node providers for staking purposes on the Orchid network, over
        periods of up to 24 months from December 16, 2019, with all amounts distributed during the first 12 months
        locked
        up in a stake for that period, and subject to a 3-month withdrawal delay.

        <h4 class="grey-heading small">User Deposits</h4>
        <p>
          To use the Orchid app, users will need to acquire OXT and move the funds they want to use for service into
          Ethereum smart contracts using the Orchid account interface. The funds are split into two categories: a
          membership deposit and a balance. The deposit is a small amount of OXT that protects against clients
          misbehaving on the network. The majority of the funds go into the balance, which is the collateral that is
          used to issue nanopayments. When a winning ticket is issued, OXT is transferred from the balance to the
          provider.

      <div>
        <h4 class="grey-heading small">Node Stake Deposits</h4>
        <p>
          Bandwidth providers on Orchid stake OXT currency in time-locked deposits to prove identity and receive traffic
          in proportion to relative stake deposit size. The stake registry is the Ethereum smart contract that holds the
          OXT. Users select Orchid server nodes with probability proportional to relative stake, thus nodes receive
          traffic and payment flow from users proportional to the amount of digital currency staked on Orchid.
        </p>

        <p>
          Providers can withdraw stake from the registry contract, but withdrawals are subject to an intentional delay
          which currently defaults to three months. Users control this delay variable by ignoring nodes with delay
          periods that are too short. This combination of linear stake weighted random selection and a withdrawal delay
          provides stronger economic security by creating a high cost barrier for takeover attacks and additionally
          helps align provider and user incentives.
